## Introduction
For the Bachelor's course Android programming of the study program Digital Media at [Fulda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-fulda.de/en/home) in summer semester 2017, we were asked to develop our own app. I developed memory card game with dogs, where you can choose the number of memory cards by yourself. This game is my first Android app that I have developed. The memory game was originally developed using Android Studio 2.3 with Gradle 3.1.3. Java 8 for Android APIs 21 (Android 5.0) to API 25 (Android 7.0).

## Updates
It has been upgraded with *Android Studio Arctic Fox 3.1.*, *Gradle 7.0.0* and *Java 11* for Android APIs 21 (Android 5.0) to API 29 (Android 8.0) since Aug 11, 2021.

## Future
No further updates were planned for the game in the future. It is public domain and free to use.

## Notes
The game currently contains the following bugs due to the upgrade:

* The Quit button does not work.
* The camera is not activated when taking photos for the cover page.
* The game can be won as soon as the second to last pair is turned over.
* Game is in English.

Thanks to U.G. for providing the dog photos.
